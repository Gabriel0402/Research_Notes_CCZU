**TLDR:** This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for generating control policies that maximize the probability of satisfying high-level control objectives. The algorithm learns from an unknown probabilistically labeled Markov Decision Process (MDP) and demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness. It also provides the best feasible policy when the satisfaction problem cannot be resolved.

## Paper summary (What)
In this paper we present a model-free RL algorithm to synthesize control policies that maximize the probability of satisfying high-level control objectives given as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.First, we propose a model-free RL algorithm to synthesize control policies for unknown PL-MDPs which maximizes the probability of satisfying LTL specifications. Second, we define a synchronous reward function and we show that maximizing the accumulated reward maximizes the satisfaction probability. Third, we convert the LTL specification into an LDBA which, as a result, shrinks the state-space that needs to explored compared to relevant LTL-to-DRA-based works in finite-state MDPs. Moreover, unlike previous works, our proposed method does not require computation of AMECs of a product MDP, which avoids the quadratic time complexity of such a computation in the size of the product MDP.

## Motivation (What)
- Reinforcement Learning has proven to be an efficient method for solving complex sequential decision-making problems in various fields.
- There is a need to develop algorithms that can handle temporal logic control synthesis with probabilistic satisfaction guarantees

## Issues addressed by the paper (Why)
This paper addresses the problem of how to generate control policies using reinforcement learning methods to maximize the probability of satisfying high-level control objectives. The context of the problem is within unknown probabilistically labeled Markov decision processes, and the primary motivation for writing this paper is to propose an effective approach to tackle this complex problem and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy through experimental results

## Detailed Information (How)
Uncertainty is considered in the workspace properties, the structure of the workspace, and the agent actions, giving rise to a Probabilistically-Labeled Markov Decision Process (PL-MDP) with unknown graph structure and stochastic behaviour, which is even more general case than a fully unknown MDP. We first
translate the LTL specification into a Limit Deterministic Büchi Automaton (LDBA), which is then used in an on-the-fly product with the PL-MDP. Thereafter, we define a synchronous reward function based on the acceptance condition of the LDBA. Finally, we show that the RL algorithm delivers a policy that maximizes the satisfaction probability asymptotically. We pro- vide experimental results that showcase the efficiency of the proposed method.

Construction of the Reward Function：The main idea is that (i) visiting a set Fj, 1 ≤ j ≤ f yields a positive reward r > 0; and (ii) revisiting the same set Fj returns zero reward until all other sets Fk, k = j are also visited; (iii) the rest of the transitions have zero rewards. Intuitively, this reward shaping strategy motivates the agent to visit all accepting sets Fj of the LDBA infinitely often, as required by the acceptance condition of the LDBA.

The main idea of Algorithm is to generate a control policy using reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to maximize the probability of satisfying a given high-level control objective (LTL formula). The key steps of this algorithm include:

1. Initialization: Initialize the action-value function Q(s, a) and the counting function C(s, a).
2. Policy Iteration: Use an ε-greedy strategy to repeatedly select actions, observe the environment, and update Q-values to approximate the optimal policy.
3. Reward Design: Create a reward function R based on the requirements of the LTL formula to encourage the agent to visit states that satisfy the LTL property.
4. Policy Improvement: Select actions using an ε-greedy policy based on the learned Q-value function, resulting in the generation of a control policy µ∗.
5. Convergence Assurance: Prove that the generated policy µ∗ maximizes the probability of satisfying the LTL property or, if it cannot be satisfied, generates a policy that is closest to satisfying the property.
6. Result Validation: Validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm through numerical experiments.

### Problem Setting
- The problem is set in the context of Reinforcement Learning for control policy synthesis.
- The goal is to maximize the probability of satisfying given temporal logic specifications.
- Evaluation settings and details about the environment, rewards, etc., would require more information from the paper.

②The probabilistic map PL provides a means to model dynamic and uncertain environments. Hereafter, we assume that the PL-MDP M is fully observable, i.e., at any time/stage t the current state, denoted by xt, and the observations in state xt, denoted by t ∈ 2AP, are known.

③The initial and accepting components of the LDBA proposed in [13] (as used in this paper) are both
